### Emulate the mobile clients minimap collapsing feature, positioning the orbs into a compact layout based on config settings. 
- Choose from a `vertical` or `horizontal` layout preset, with the added ability for positioning `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` of the minimap container
- Control the visibility of any minimap orb (wiki banner, world map & xp included)

*(Note: Layouts are only supported in `resizable-classic` and `resizable-modern` display modes! Orb hiding works in all display modes)*

**Reposition the ``orbs`` into a compact layout based on config settings. (with improved customization options)**

-`vertical` or `horizontal` switches between the different layout presets, by default: [`vertical`, `right`]

--`horizontal position`: Top, Bottom

--`Vertical position`: Left, Right

- *(Tip: With RuneLites native feature, holding ``alt`` will allow you to move the ``orbs`` container!)*

**Interactive toggle buttons:**

- ``Minimap`` can be toggled, enabling the compact layout.

- ``Compass`` can be toggled, but *only* during compact layout. *(Will revert when minimap becomes visible)*

- More control over the toggle button visibility from the config settings, or via hotkey: `shift + insert` by default

**Hide or Show any Orb:**

- Can now control the visibility of any minimap orb (if enabled via in-game settings)
- Logout tab is still accessible in `modern-resizable` via hotkey if `logout x` is hidden
- World map hotkey will retain the `Ctrl + M` hotkey (if enabled via in-game settings) if `world map` is hidden

Config side panel should handle all the customization options you'd need! However, there are some exceptions for certain things:

In order to hide or show certain orbs, you have to make sure they are enabled via the in-game settings.

The affected orbs are; `wiki` `store` `activity`

In-game setting examples:

-``store``

- and `wiki` is the same - however, the Wiki-plugin may cause issues initially, it is handled!
